Once upon a time there was a man walking along the Hauptstrasse.
Until suddenly, he came across a hund wearing lederhose.
Confused but curious, the man followed the Hund into a Biergarten in Berlin for Bratwurst.
Right as the Hund entered the Biergarten, the local Rammstein immediately stopped their music and everyone turned to look at the Hund.
The Hund, unfazed, strutted past the Biergarten tables straight to the Ratskeller, hoping to snag a slice of Apfelkuchen.
Among the different Gebaeck he found the Apfelkuchen he wanted between the Brot and the Doener.
Suddenly the Hund burst out of the Ratskeller, Apfelkuchen in mouth, covered in flour, looking like a Mehlhase.
The wettbewerbsfaehig man took it as a challenge and chased down the Hund, who had been running down the Hauptstrasse.
