Once upon a time there was a man walking along the Hauptstrasse.
until suddenly, he came across a hund wearing lederhose.
Confused but curious, the man followed the Hund into a Biergarten in Berlin for Bratwurst.
Right as the Hund entered the Biergarten, the local Rammstein immediately stopped their music and everyone turned to look at the Hund.
